      <div class="cd-faq-content">
         <p>
            BestGadget realizes the importance of a strong fraud detection and resolution capability. We and
            our online
            payments partners monitor transactions continuously for suspicious activity and flag potentially
            fraudulent
            transactions for manual verification by our team.
         </p>
         <p>
            In the rarest of rare cases, when our team is unable to rule out the possibility of fraud
            categorically,
            the
            transaction is kept on hold, and the customer is requested to provide identity documents. The ID
            documents
            help
            us ensure that the purchases were indeed made by a genuine card holder. We apologise for any
            inconvenience
            that
            may be caused to customers and request them to bear with us in the larger interest of ensuring a
            safe and
