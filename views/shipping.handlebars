            <p> Delivery charge varies with each Seller.</p>
            <p>Sellers incur relatively higher shipping costs on low value items. In such cases, charging a
               nominal
               delivery
               charge helps them offset logistics costs. Please check your order summary to understand the

               It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between the day your
               placed
               your
               order
               and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this
               case,
               we
               add a day
               to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is
               factored in
               to the
               delivery dates.

               Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page.

               Estimated delivery time depends on the following factors:
            <ul>
               <li>The Seller offering the product</li>
               <li>Product's availability with the Seller</li>

            <p>
               You have probably noticed varying estimated delivery times for sellers of the product you are
               interested
               in.
               Delivery times are influenced by product availability, geographic location of the Seller, your
               shipping
               destination and the courier partner's time-to-deliver in your location.

               Please enter your default pin code on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single
               time)
               to

               Please enter your pincode on the product page (you don't have to enter it every single time) to
               know
               whether
               the product can be delivered to your location.

               If you haven't provided your pincode until the checkout stage, the pincode in your shipping address
               will be
               used to check for serviceability.
            </p>
            <p>
               Whether your location can be serviced or not depends on:
            <ul>
               <li>Whether the Seller ships to your location</li>
               <li>Legal restrictions, if any, in shipping particular products to your location</li>
               <li>The availability of reliable courier partners in your location</li>
            </ul>
            At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their discretion.

         <div class="cd-faq-content">
            <p>
               Availability of CoD depends on the ability of our courier partner servicing your location to accept
               cash as
               payment at the time of delivery.
            </p>
            <p>
               Our courier partners have limits on the cash amount payable on delivery depending on the
               destination
               and
               your
               order value might have exceeded this limit. Please enter your pin code on the product page to check
               if

               cannot
               be
               arranged through BGkart, you can return the item through a third-party courier service. Return fees
               are

               <b>'In Stock'</b><br>
               For items listed as "In Stock", Sellers will mention the delivery time based on your location
               pincode
               (usually
               2-3 business days, 4-5 business days or 4-6 business days in areas where standard courier service
               is
               available). For other areas, orders will be sent by Registered Post through the USPS
               which
               may
               take 1-2 weeks depending on the location.<br><br>
               <b>'Available'</b><br>
               The Seller might not have the item in stock but can procure it when an order is placed for the
               item.
               The
               delivery time will depend on the estimated procurement time and the estimated shipping time to your
               location.<br><br>
               <b>'Preorder' or 'Forthcoming'</b><br>
               Such items are expected to be released soon and can be pre-booked for you. The item will be shipped

               you
               on
               the day of it's official release launch and will reach you in 2 to 6 business days. The Preorder
               duration
               varies from item to item. Once known, release time and date is mentioned. (Eg. 5th May, August 3rd

               <b>'Out of Stock'</b><br>
               Currently, the item is not available for sale. Use the 'Notify Me' feature to know once it is

               <b>'Imported'</b><br>
               Sometimes, items have to be sourced by Sellers from outside USA. These items are mentioned as

               on
               the product page and can take at least 10 days or more to be delivered to you.
